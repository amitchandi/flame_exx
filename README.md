# Flame Solitaire Klondike

A flutter game using the flame engine.

## Klondike - Flame Tutorial Expanded

This project is a continuation of the incomplete tutorial from Flame:
[Flame Klondike Tutorial](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.5.0/tutorials/klondike/klondike.html)

The tutorial leaves off at a game that can be completed, but is missing a few key features.
I've added the following features to the game:

- An undo button to undo your moves.
- A reset button to start a new game.
- Animations for undone moves and returned cards.
- Animations for new games.
- Autocomplete games when certain condtions are met by automatically moving cards to the foundation pile.
